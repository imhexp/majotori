    <txt>The sky was clear and the Moon was full.
    <txt>Oliver was fascinated by its beauty.
    <txt>He howled and howled, but the Moon wouldn't howl back.
    <txt>So he kept howling, until a shadow appeared on the Moon.

    <txt>"What are you doing?", asked the shadow.
    <txt>"You are a dog, not a wolf; you are not supposed to howl at the Moon."
    <txt>"Sound doesn't even travel through space. The Moon can't hear you."

    <txt>"But I can fix that."
    <txt>Somehow, Oliver sort of understood what the shadow was trying to say, even though he was a dog.
    <txt>They made some kind of deal and the shadow began asking questions.

    <txt>Oliver howled as hard as he could.

    <txt>This time his howl traveled through space, reached the Moon and bounced back.

    <txt>It seemed as if the Moon was howling back at him.
    <txt>Oliver felt loved.
