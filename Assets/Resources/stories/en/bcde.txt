    <txt>It was the final game of the national high school baseball championship.
    <txt>As the ace of the team, Carl was expected to lead the way to victory.
    <txt>The pressure was unbearable.
    <txt>"Everything is going to be alright", he repeated to himself.
    <txt>But it was more of a wish than actual conviction.

    <txt>Suddenly, he realized a little witch was beside him.
    <txt>Lariat offered him the deal and Carl accepted it.

    <txt>The game began and Carl's hands stopped shaking.
    <txt>He had never been so focused before.
    <img>bcde/carl_pitching
    <txt>He pitched as well as he ever had. No batter was able to even touch the ball.
    <txt>It was a smashing victory.

    <txt>Daisy was in love with Carl, the ace of the baseball team.
    <txt>Ever since she had discovered he didn't have a girlfriend, she had tried to confess.
    <txt>But she didn't have the courage to tell him.
    <txt>Prom was coming, so Daisy decided that was her chance.
    <txt>She asked him to meet her in front of his locker. She was determined.
    <txt>Or so she had thought.
    <img>bcde/daisy_hiding
    <txt>But the moment she saw him waiting, she panicked. She was paralyzed.
    <txt>She closed her eyes and wished she had the courage to do it; to ask him to go with her to prom.
    <img>bcde/daisy_hiding_deal
    <txt>When Daisy opened her eyes again, there was a witch looking at her.
    <txt>Lariat offered her the deal and Daisy accepted it.

	<txt>Filled with courage, Daisy walked straight to Carl.
	<txt>"Go to prom with me!", she demanded.
	<txt>"Yes ma'am!", he answered.
	<img>bcde/lockers2
	<txt>A burst of embarrassment ran through Daisy's body.
	<txt>"I didn't expect to be asked so abruptly!", said Carl, laughing.
	<txt>Daisy was so relieved!

    <txt>Carl came to pick Daisy up at her house.
    <txt>Prom night was finally here!
    <img>bcde/prom_daisy_carl
    <txt>It was a magical night.
    <txt>They talked and laughed and danced.
    <txt>For a moment it appeared as if they were going to kiss.
    <txt>But Daisy panicked once more and didn't allow it to happen.
    <txt>Nervous, she excused herself and went to the restroom to calm down.
    <img>bcde/daisy_bathroom
    <txt>It was happening again. Her lack of courage was going to ruin everything.
    <img>bcde/daisy_bathroom_deal
    <txt>"Do you need help?", said Lariat, appearing from the toilet.
    <txt>Lariat offered her the deal and Daisy accepted it.

    <txt>Daisy returned just in time for a slow ballad.
    <txt>They danced close together.

    <txt>They kissed.

    <txt>That prom night two weeks ago turned out to be more magical than Carl had expected.
    <txt>Daisy had told him that there was something weird going on in her body.
    <txt>She suspected that she may be pregnant, and she was happy about it.
    <txt>But Carl wasn't. He did not want to become a father. Not yet, at least.
    <txt>Daisy was going to take a pregnancy test today.
    <txt>Carl would soon receive her phone call with the results.

    <txt>Daisy forced herself to do it!
    <txt>She forced herself so bad it was more of a bite than a kiss.
    <img>bcde/prom_daisy_carl_disgusted
    <txt>Carl pushed her away, annoyed and in pain.
    <txt>Daisy had ruined the night.

    <txt>There was no escape.
    <img>bcde/lockers_worry
    <txt>"There you are. Did you want to tell me something?", asked Carl.
    <txt>Daisy knew she couldn't do it. She couldn't bring herself to tell him.
    <txt>"Could I... borrow your math book?", she asked instead.
    <txt>Her chance was lost, along with her hope.

	<txt>Elsa was the founder and only member of the manga club.
	<txt>Apparently manga wasn't popular among the students in her high school, so she didn't have many friends.
	<txt>One day she started reading a romance manga about high school girls.
	<txt>The main character of the story was the least popular girl in school.
	<txt>But surprisingly, the hottest girl in school asked her on a date!
	<txt>Then she remembered that prom was coming up.
	<txt>She closed her eyes and fantasized about being the main character of that manga.
	<txt>She wished for a hot girl to ask her to go to prom with her.
	<img>bcde/manga_club_lariat
	<txt>When she opened her eyes again, there was a beautiful witch by the door.

    <txt>She was so lucky!
    <txt>But maybe she hadn't given it enough thought.
    <txt>What would happen now? They probably had nothing in common.
    <txt>Was it going to be an awkward night?
    <txt>Would Daisy hate her and regret going with her?

    <img>bcde/prom_elsa_daisy_dance

    <txt>She had been cheering when he became a hero on the championship finals.
    <txt>But when she found him by the lockers, he was talking to another girl!
    <txt>Was he going to ask her to the prom?!

    <txt>Barbara suddenly remembered that there was an official perfect couple: the prom king and queen.
