    <txt>Woolie was a loser with no future.
    <txt>He didnâ€™t continue studying after high school and hadn't done anything productive ever since.
    <txt>He was lazy and spent his days playing video games.
    <txt>It was only a matter of time before he would be forced to work a soul crushing, badly paid job.
    <txt>But what if he made his lifestyle profitable?
    <txt>He was in the internet era and he knew plenty about video games.
    <txt>If he managed to create a popular video channel, he could make a living.

    <txt>A year had passed since Woolie had become a famous video game player and commentator, and he was becoming stale.
    <img>woolie_xiang/woolie_pc_sad
    <txt>Every day he had fewer followers than the last, and the group of people who openly despised him kept growing.
    <txt>He had to do something now, before all his popularity was gone.
    <txt>He wished he had asked that witch her email address.
    <img>woolie_xiang/screen_lariat
    <txt>"Do you wish for my email?", asked Lariat, appearing on the computer screen.

    <txt>Desperate, Woolie began to overdo his reactions and force jokes into his videos.
    <txt>He even dyed his hair green to give himself a new look.
    <img>woolie_xiang/woolie_pc_sad_green

    <txt>Before long no one cared about him anymore and he fell into oblivion.
