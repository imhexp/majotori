    <txt>When Yvette and her team arrived, the fire had already taken most of the house.

    <txt>"My son! My little son is still inside!", screamed a woman.
    <img>yvette_zelotes/too_dangerous
    <txt>"We can't go in there!", said one of Yvette's colleagues.
    <txt>But she wasn't listening.
    <img>yvette_zelotes/stairs
    <txt>She entered the house and found the boy.
    <img>yvette_zelotes/trapped
    <txt>But then the house began to collapse!
    <txt>The way out was blocked!
    <txt>She looked around, desperately wishing to find an opening.

    <txt>Instead, she found a witch.
    <txt>"There's no time!", the witch said.
    <txt>"We have to make a deal!"
    <txt>Yvette didn't even ask for the details. This was her only option.

    <txt>"Congratulations", said Lariat, and then she vanished.
    <img>yvette_zelotes/exit
    <txt>One of the walls of the house collapsed, revealing the outdoor.
    <txt>Yvette took the chance and jumped without thinking it twice.

    <txt>Then she herself collapsed.
    <img>yvette_zelotes/hospital
    <txt>She woke up in a hospital bed.
    <txt>The kid she had rescued and his mother were there to thank her.

    <txt>"When I grow up, I'm gonna be a firefighter just like you!", he said.
    <txt>Yvette was moved.

    <txt>"Sorry", said Lariat, and then she vanished.
    <img>yvette_zelotes/yvette_sacrifice
    <txt>The ceiling started collapsing.
    <txt>Yvette placed herself as a shield for the boy in a vain attempt to save him.
    <txt>They both died in the fire.

    <txt>Zelotes had finally made his dream come true.
    <txt>After so many years of hard work, he was now officially an astronaut.
    <img>yvette_zelotes/space_satellite
    <txt>He entered the selection process of a satellite station maintenance mission.
    <txt>If he was chosen, he would be able to go to space!
    <img>yvette_zelotes/zelotes_study
    <txt>He had done well in the physical trials, but this mission required exceptional theoretical knowledge.
    <txt>He closed his eyes and wished to do well on the exam.

    <txt>Lariat appeared, and you know how it goes.

    <img>yvette_zelotes/zelotes_exam
    <txt>The day of the exam arrived.
    <txt>All the questions were about things he had studied!
    <txt>He nailed it!

    <img>yvette_zelotes/space_satellite
    <txt>Zelotes was maintaining a satellite station in space when something went horribly wrong.
    <img>yvette_zelotes/space_satellite_explosion
    <txt>A compartment of the satellite suddenly exploded.
    <img>yvette_zelotes/zelotes_sucked
    <txt>Everything was being sucked into space.
    <txt>His companion managed to grab his hand, but Zelotes knew she wasn't strong enough to save them both.
    <img>yvette_zelotes/zelotes_sucked2
    <txt>In a heroic act, he sacrificed himself.
    <img>yvette_zelotes/zelotes_floating
    <txt>Moments later, Zelotes was floating away in the void of space.
    <txt>He wondered if his oxygen would run out before he died of hypothermia.
    <txt>He wished he could get back to the satellite, somehow.
    <img>yvette_zelotes/zelotes_floating_deal
    <txt>"Do you want a little push in that direction?", asked Lariat, appearing in a yellow space suit.
    <txt>She had her helmet open!
    <txt>On second thought, that sort of made sense, her being a witch and all.
    <txt>Zelotes really had nothing to lose from the deal.

<a1a1a1>
    <txt>"Congratulations", said Lariat, and then she pushed him.
    <img>yvette_zelotes/zelotes_floating_satellite
    <txt>Zelotes was now floating towards the satellite.
    <img>yvette_zelotes/zelotes_window
    <txt>When his companion saw him, she couldn't believe it.
    <txt>They managed to stabilize the satellite and come back home safe.

<a1a1a0>
    <txt>"Sorry", said Lariat, and then she vanished.
    <img>yvette_zelotes/zelotes_floating
    <txt>Not much later, he had to wonder no more.
    <txt>It was hypothermia.

<a1a0>
    <txt>"Sorry", said Lariat, and then she vanished.
    <img>yvette_zelotes/zelotes_exam_bad
    <txt>The day of the exam arrived.
    <txt>Zelotes was so nervous his mind went blank.
    <txt>He couldn't remember any of the answers!
    <txt>He wouldn't be going into space any time soon.
