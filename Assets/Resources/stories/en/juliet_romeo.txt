    <txt>Juliet had met a boy that day at a ball held by his family.
    <txt>A wonderful boy named Romeo.
    <txt>But he was from an enemy family.
    <txt>Her family had found out that he had sneaked into the ball and had threatened to kill him if they ever saw him again.
    <txt>But Juliet needed to see him again. She was in love!
    <txt>She went to the balcony and closed her eyes, wishing for Romeo to appear when she opened them again.

    <txt>Juliet heard a sound coming from the bushes.
    <img>juliet_romeo/bushes_romeo
    <txt>It was Romeo sneaking into the garden!
    <img>juliet_romeo/juliet_balcony_romeo
    <txt>"I love you!", said Romeo.
    <img>juliet_romeo/juliet2
    <txt>"I love you too!", said Juliet.
    <img>juliet_romeo/juliet_balcony_romeo
    <txt>"Let's get married!", proposed Romeo.

    <txt>Romeo had asked Juliet to marry him, but everyone knew their families were enemies.
    <txt>Who would be willing to marry them in secret?
    <img>juliet_romeo/romeo_deal
    <txt>"I know someone who would be", said a witch, appearing out of nowhere.
    <txt>"Let's make a deal."

    <txt>"Congratulations", said Lariat, and then she vanished.
    <img>juliet_romeo/romeo_friar
    <txt>Just then, a friar who was a friend of Romeo's family passed by.
    <txt>Romeo explained the situation to him.
    <txt>"Such a union could end the animosity between both your families", he said.
    <txt>"I'll do it!"
    <img>juliet_romeo/romeo_juliet_wedding
    <txt>That same night they met in secret.
    <txt>Romeo and Juliet were declared husband and wife.

    <img>juliet_romeo/juliet_parents
    <txt>When Juliet's family heard about her wedding with Romeo, they were livid.
    <txt>They didn't accept their union and wanted Juliet to marry someone of their choosing instead.
    <img>juliet_romeo/juliet_poison
    <txt>Juliet had a plan.
    <txt>She would drink a potion that would put her in a deathlike coma.
    <txt>Then Romeo would come rescue her from the crypt and they would flee together.
    <txt>But would Romeo understand that she was not actually dead?
    <img>juliet_romeo/juliet_poison_deal
    <txt>"I'll make sure he understands", said Lariat, appearing behind her.
    <txt>"Let's play."

    <txt>Juliet drank the potion and fell into a deathlike coma.
    <img>juliet_romeo/juliet_crypt
    <txt>When her family found out, they believed her dead and took her to the family's crypt.
    <img>juliet_romeo/romeo_crypt
    <txt>The news eventually reached Romeo, who then went to see her.
    <txt>Refusing to believe she was dead, he waited at her side.
    <img>juliet_romeo/juliet_wakes
    <txt>Eventually, Juliet woke up.
    <img>juliet_romeo/parents
    <txt>They fled together, but when their families heard the story, they asked them to come back.
    <txt>They were so moved by the strength of their love that they ended their enmity.
    <img>juliet_romeo/romeo_juliet_happy
    <txt>Juliet and Romeo lived happily together.

<a1a1a0>
    <txt>"Sorry", said Lariat, and then she vanished.
    <img>juliet_romeo/juliet_coma
    <txt>Juliet went on with her plan anyway, trusting that Romeo would understand.
    <txt>She drank the potion and fell into a deathlike coma.

    <txt>Even if that witch wasn't going to help, Romeo had to at least try.
    <txt>He approached a friar who was a friend of his family and explained the situation.
    <img>juliet_romeo/angry_friar
    <txt>"I will not allow this union!", furiously said the friar.
    <txt>"I will tell your parents about your relationship at once!"
    <txt>After that, Romeo and Juliet were forbidden to see each other ever again.

<a0>
    <txt>"Sorry", said Lariat, and then she vanished.
    <img>juliet_romeo/juliet
