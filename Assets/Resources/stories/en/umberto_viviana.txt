    <txt>But maybe in a different way than Umberto had intended.
    <img>umberto_viviana/plane_engine
    <txt>When he was at the highest point, the engine started to malfunction and smoke.
    <txt>If the engine didn't hold together until the landing, he was going to crash!

    <txt>Suddenly, a co-pilot appeared.
    <txt>"Hi, I'm Lariat the witch", she said.
    <txt>"There's no time to explain; just play with me."

    <txt>Viviana's grandfather was going to retire to his cabin in the mountains.
    <txt>He had offered her a generous pay if she cleaned the place up.
    <img>umberto_viviana/viviana_mess
    <txt>She happily accepted, but the job turned out to be more daunting than she had expected.
    <txt>It was too much for her to do alone! She didn't even know where to begin!
    <txt>She wished she had someone there to help her organize.
    <img>umberto_viviana/viviana_mess_deal
    <txt>Then, from between the mess a witch leaned out.
    <txt>The witch offered Viviana a deal and she accepted it.

    <txt>"Congratulations", said Lariat, and then she got to work.

    <txt>At the end of the day everything was sparkling.

    <txt>Her grandfather was so pleased, he paid her extra!

    <txt>"Sorry", said Lariat, and then she vanished.

    <txt>"Sorry", said Lariat, and then she vanished.

    <txt>Viviana's grandfather had died in a tragic plane accident a few weeks ago.
    <txt>In his will, he stated that she would inherit his cabin in the mountains if she spent a night alone in it.
    <txt>What an odd condition.
    <img>umberto_viviana/viviana_mess_night
    <txt>The place was dirty and gloomy, but that wasn't going to stop her.
    <img>umberto_viviana/viviana_noises
    <txt>Everything was going well until strange noises started coming from the second floor.
    <txt>"It's just the wind", she muttered to herself.
    <img>umberto_viviana/viviana_mess_deal_night
    <txt>"Is it?", asked Lariat, appearing out of nowhere.
    <txt>A witch! The cabin was haunted after all!
    <txt>"Relax. I'm here to help you", said Lariat.
    <txt>"Play with me and I'll make the scary noises go away."
    <txt>Viviana didn't feel like disobeying a witch.

    <txt>Dawn arrived without any more setbacks.
    <txt>The cabin was now legally hers!

    <txt>"Sorry", said Lariat, and then she vanished.
    <img>umberto_viviana/viviana_noises2
    <txt>The noises intensified.
    <txt>It couldn't be just the wind! There was someone locked upstairs, knocking on a door!
    <img>umberto_viviana/viviana_flee
    <txt>Viviana was so afraid she ran away right in the middle of the night.
    <img>umberto_viviana/viviana_cliff
