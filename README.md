# Majotori
Best guess of Majotori's source code, a trivia game developed by Majorariatto, a spanish indie game studio.

This code contains very little changes, just the ones required for the code to compile. The code is not accurate, it is not bug-free, but it is more than suitable to make some crazy ports and modifications.

## Building
1. Clone this repo
```
git clone https://github.com/imhexp/majotori.git
```
2. Open the repo with Unity 2017.4.40f1
3. Build. Code *should* compile on Windows and WebGL without requiring any notable changes.

## Contributing
This is just a reconstruction and I don't plan working on it.

However, if you find a bug and you know how to fix it, I'll be more than happy to review your PR and merge it, given it meets some minimum quality requirements.
